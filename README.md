# Odin_Calculator

This calculator was made for the Odin Project, an open source curriculum for learning and improving webdevelopment skills.

I had a lot of fun working on this project. The visuals of the calculator where rather easy to make using css-grid. The javascript on the other hand turned out to be much more of a challenge.
